# FitTracker
This is an application that allows you to track your basic fitness goals.

USER STORY:

 My name is wendy and as a user, I want to be able to view, create and track my daily workouts. I have goals I need to meet and checking my progress is a must. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I feel like I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled, no excuses!

 LETS GET TO WORK!

 When the user loads the page, they should be given the option to create a new workout, or continue with their last workout.

The user should be able to:

  * Add exercises to a previous workout plan.

  * Add new exercises to a new workout plan.

  * View multiple the combined weight of multiple exercises on the `stats` page
